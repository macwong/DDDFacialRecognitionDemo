What is Facial Recognition?

What we will be looking at:
* How does it work?
* Accuracy
* Performance
* Technologies

## How does it work? (5 minutes)
* What is going on between the input and the output?
* Pipeline Overview
* Input
* Face Detection
* Conversion
* Prediction
* Output
* Live demo (my face)
    * Demo with me not in training set
    * Add me to training set

## Accuracy (4 minutes)
* Accuracy scale
* Measuring accuracy
* What can affect accuracy?
* Live demo
    * Facial expressions (me)
    * Occlusions (me)
    * Age differences (image)
    * Makeup differences (image)
    * Lighting conditions (image)
    * Doppelgangers (image)

## Performance (3 minutes)
* Performance considerations
* Live demo
    * Normal with simple CPU (me)
    * 5000+ people in training set (me)
    * ~100 faces to predict (everyone? Or image depending on time and circumstances)

## Technologies (2 minutes)
* Technologies (client-side)
    * UI
    * Image Input

* Technologies (server-side)
    * Web Service
    * Face Detection
    * Conversion
    * Prediction
