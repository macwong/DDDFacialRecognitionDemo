# DDD Presentation – Understanding Facial Recognition

## Warm-Up (15 min)
Cycle through images to predict, some informative and some humorous

## Intro (2 minute)
What is Facial Recognition?

What we will be looking at:
* How does it work?
* Training
* Accuracy
* Performance
* Technologies

## How does it work? (5 minutes)
* What is going on between the input and the output?
* Pipeline Overview
* Input
* Face Detection
* Conversion
* Prediction
* Output
* Live demo

## Training (3 minutes)
* "Trained" model
* Photos of each person
* Can be as little as 1 photo per person (one-shot learning)
* Should be consistent amount of photos per person (depending on algorithm)
* Can use online learning
* Training pipeline
* Input
* Face Detection
* Conversion
* Output (saved model with 512 embeddings per face)
* Live demo


## Accuracy (4 minutes)
* Measuring accuracy
* What can affect predictions?
* Live demo

## Performance (3 minutes)
* Performance considerations
* Live demo

## Technologies (2 minutes)
* Technologies used – server side
* Technologies used – client side

## Conclusion (1 minute)
* Resources
* Questions?
